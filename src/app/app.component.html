     <p class="card-text">"Moped" is a portmanteau of "motor" and "pedal." It refers to a small, lightweight motorized bicycle that typically has a low-powered engine, often with a displacement less than 50cc. Mopeds usually feature both pedals for human-powered propulsion and a small engine for motorized assistance. They are popular for short-distance urban commuting due to their fuel efficiency and ease of maneuverability.</p>
